                <h3>About an hour of your time could change someoneâ€™s life.</h3>
                <p>

                    Blood and blood products are a critical part of everyday medical care including major surgeries,
                    medical procedures, cancer treatments and managing diseases and disorders. As a blood donor you
                    form a
                    vital link in Canada's lifeline, helping many Canadians wake up healthy each day.
                    Your blood type determines who you can donate blood to and receive blood from. There are eight main
                    blood types organized from a combination of two systems: ABO blood types (A, B, O, AB) and Rh type
                    (positive or negative).

                    These eight blood types are: O-positive, O-negative, A-positive, A-negative, B-positive,
                    B-negative,
                    AB-positive, and AB-negative

                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    The Health Department of the Pakistan Red Crescent was established as early as the establishment of
                    the
                    PRC. Presently, the PRC Health Department runs 104 health centres. 69 Health Centres are supported
                    by
                    the PRC provincial branches. The remaining 35 Health Centres are supported by the NHQ through
                    funding
                    received from the Movement Partners.

                    The PRC is seen as a pioneer and a leader in transfusion medicine and research; it has provided
                    generations of Pakistanis with blood products that are safe and reliable. It also has extensive
                    Ambulance Services and First Aid Services.

                    The PRC has also been developing long-term programming such as HIV/AIDS prevention and awareness
                    program and Community Base Health and First Aid. It also conducts regular health awareness training
                    on
                    various issues of public health priority.

                    In addition to the above-mentioned programs, the PRC Health Department has developed its capacity
                    to
                    respond effectively to health emergencies at the national level.

                    Since the 2005 earthquake operation, the PRC health team has built up emergency health stocks
                    besides
                    developing its capacity to effectively respond to natural and man-made disasters, disease outbreaks
                    etc.

                    The PRC Health and Care Strategy 2011-2015 describes three situational settings for health
                    interventions; emergency health situations, peace time/normal circumstances and disaster
                    situations.
